Currently, I'm working in 4D Flow imaging. So, I have studied from the basic of flow imaging and phase constrast technique to reconstruct the flow of aortic to have my own thought to develop my philosophy ^^.
  
In this blog, I am going to introduce the basic concept of flow imaging, the limitations and challenges in this field, espcially 4D Flow imaging. 

## What is FLOW IMAGING?
