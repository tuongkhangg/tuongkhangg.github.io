&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Khang Duong, a computer scientist. I grew up in a small town, then come to Ho Chi Minh city to continue my student life. I am proud to have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Information Technology, Hochiminh Vietnam National University.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research interest is in medical image processing, computer vision, machine learning and deep leanring. Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a range of impactful projects that are closely aligned with my research interests, namely:
1. <ins>Brain Segmentation on MRI Images:</ins>  developed model segmented tumor on 2D image brain, making processing easier. Input is 2D MRI image, the output is a segmented tumor section on the image.

2. <ins>HCM AI Challenge - Detecting vehicles in video:</ins> developed an end-to-end model. The model could detect objects like
a truck, motos, buses, and containers; count the number of vehicles in the area in real time.

3. <ins>Build an information retrieval model in the travel field:</ins> developed a model to query information about places, fares, location
information and services related to tourist destinations. Data is collected from
travel websites and news sources such as vnexpress.vn, tuoitre.vn, ...

4. <ins>RSNA Screen mammography breast cancer detection:</ins> developed a model to classify whether a patient has cancer or not on screening mammography.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Currently, I'm seeking for a MS or PhD position***, which will provide the platform to deepen my expertise and make substantive contributions to the scientific community. I'm best reached via email (khangdlt1010@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
