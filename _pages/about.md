I am proud to have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Information Technology, Hochiminh Vietnam National University.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research interest is in medical image processing, computer vision, machine learning and deep learning. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Currently, I'm a grad student in the MISL (Sungkyunkwan University)***, especially I'm working on **4D Flow MRI**. I'm best reached via email (khangdlt1010@gmail.com).
